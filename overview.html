    <h2 class="margins">How Minecraft works</h2>
    <h3 class="margins">What is Minecraft?</h3>
    <p class="margins">Minecraft is a sandbox video game that allows players to build and explore virtual worlds made up
        of blocks. In the game, players can gather resources, craft items, and build structures to create their own
        unique worlds.</p>
    <p class="margins">The gameplay in Minecraft is open-ended and allows players to choose their own goals and
        objectives. Some players may choose to focus on building and creating, while others may prefer to explore and
        survive in the game’s various biomes, which include forests, deserts, oceans, and more. There are so many
        gameplay options that it is impossible to list them all.</p>
    <p class="margins">Minecraft also includes a variety of different gameplay modes, including survival mode, creative
        mode, and adventure mode. In survival mode, players must gather resources and maintain their health in order to
        survive, while in creative mode, players have unlimited resources and are free to build and create without any
        limitations. Adventure mode allows players to experience custom-made maps and challenges created by other
        players.
    </p>

    <h3 class="margins">How do I play Minecraft?</h3>
    <p class="margins">The first step is to ensure that you have the required information technology to run Minecraft.
        The hardware is illustrated in the system requirements below, as well as the software. The most important
        software you likely don’t already have is Minecraft, and you can purchase and install it on <a
            href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/get-minecraft">Minecraft’s website</a>. Afterwards, create a world and
        enjoy the only time you can play it for the first time, when everything is a fresh experience. There is no guide
        required, nor tutorial that is necessary to follow because of how intuitive Minecraft is. There’s no harm in
        experimenting. If you want more information about Minecraft, its <a
            href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki">Wiki</a> is very helpful and if you want
        inspiration, there are many Youtube Channels, such as <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChFur_NwVSbUozOcF_F2kMg">Mumbo Jumbo</a> for redstone, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR9Gcq0CMm6YgTzsDxAxjOQ">Grian</a> for building and <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dream">Dream</a> for speedrunning. The video below examines a few basic game
        mechanics that Minecraft has. Additionally, since Minecraft is so popular, it is easy to ask friends in real
        life what they’ve done in Minecraft and play with them! If your current friends don’t use it, you may be able to
        go to a club at a local library where enthusiasts can meet. </p>

            <p>
                To play multiplayer Minecraft with friends in close physical proximity, LAN is a good option. This
                involves connecting to the same WiFi network and requires that the devices are able to connect to Wifi
                including hardware such as a network interface card. Other ways to play include online servers that are
                hosted online and require WiFi or mobile data. WiFi networks connect their network to the wider itnernet
                through modems.

                This can be any combination of a game controller, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, stylus, and webcam that
                allows players to use some controls by blinking and moving their eyes.

            <h3>Output devices</h3>
            <p>
                Most devices use a monitor, however, Minecraft Java Edition allows the narrator to perform screen
                reading for chat messages and some description of the world around the player that is displayed as audio
                through speakers. Additionally, screen projectors can hypothetically be used. VR Headsets are a
                relatively common output device.

    <h3 class="margins">Software</h3>
    <ul class="margins">
        <li><b>Minecraft</b>: Minecraft can clearly only be played when the computer has its code to execute</li>
        <li><b>Filesystem</b>: Minecraft needs to access the operating system’s filesystem so that it can persistently
            store and retrieve the worlds. </li>
        <li><b>OS</b>: Most modern operating systems can run Minecraft, although some are more performant than others
            and run different versions</li>
        <li><b>Drivers</b>: The computer needs to know how to communicate with the hardware and peripherals. </li>

            <h3>Privacy of the individual & safety</h3>

            <p>
                Whenever children are online, it is imperative that they are supervised. They may unknowingly share
                their personal data with strangers which could endanger them and lead to kidnappings. In Australia, it
                is rated as PG which means that caregivers are recommended to supervise children under 15 due to the
                fantasy violence and the experience that may change online<sup>[<a
                        href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/minecraft">1</a>]</sup>. The Norfolk police <a
                    href="https://www.norfolk.police.uk/sites/norfolk/files/minecraft.pdf">warn against</a>
                "communicating with strangers" because of the "explicit pictures" and "real-life encounters" they
                suggest.

        <div class="col3">
            <img src="assets/privacy.png" alt="">
            <h3>Security of data</h3>
            <p>
                Payment details are required for Bedrock Edition’s Marketplace and are often how players purchase
                Minecraft. It’s data security is particularly significant because of these high stakes and the
                consequences of credit card fraud compared to other free games without in-app purchases. The data needs
                to be encrypted as it travels to Microsoft’s servers so it can’t be eavesdropped by cybercriminals and
                when stored there in case of data breaches.

            <img src="assets/net-etiquette.jpg" alt="">
            <h3>Net-etiquette</h3>
            <p>
                Minecraft players are morally obliged to be respectful to each other in the chat by following social
                expectations of online conduct. Players should use slang both exclusive to Minecraft like <i>op</i>,
                which means administrative privileges, and acronyms used commonly on the internet such as lol meaning
                "laugh out loud". Another potent example is how ALL-CAPS symbolises shouting. <i>Griefing</i>, the
                unauthorised vandalism of other people’s creations, is relatively common and refraining from it is an
                application of net-etiquette relevant to Minecraft.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="margins">
        Minecraft has many other social and ethical issues that weren’t referenced like equity because of Minecraft’s
        high price tag, inconsistent pricing between platforms and high rates of piracy. Others include ergonomic issues
        with players using Minecraft for hours at a time and copyright both Minecraft’s source code and Minecraft worlds
        and assets found on the Marketplace. Minecraft also has many mitigations for these issues not referenced.
