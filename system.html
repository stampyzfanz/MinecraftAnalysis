    <h1 class="moveHigher">Minecraft: a system</h1>
    <p class="margins">Minecraft takes inputs as data, returns outputs as information so that its direct users gain
        knowledge and the system’s purpose is fulfilled. Key aspects of Minecraft’s design can be analysed when
        interpreted under a lens as an information system such as how everything links together in a diagram, the
        information technology requirements when run and the fields of expertise that are involved within the system’s
        creation. </p>

    <h2 class="margins">Information systems diagram</h2>
    <p class="margins"></p>
    <div class="wide">
        <img src="assets/Minecraft Information System.svg" class="large-image wide-image" alt="">
    </div>

    <h2 class="margins">Fields of expertise involved in the system’s creation</h2>
    <p class="margins">
        Minecraft could be considered a multimedia product because of its identity clearly being a virtual world, which
        is epitomic of multimedia systems. It contains abundant text, images, animation, audio, video and hyperlinks.
        Thus, Minecraft’s participants can be largely categorised by the types of roles that form a multimedia system.
    </p>

    <p class="margins">
        Minecraft’s <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/credits">credits webpage</a>, amalgamated with various
        additional sources, sheds light on the roles and responsibilities of people who work to help design and create
        Minecraft which are as follows:
    </p>

    <h3 class="margins">Project managers and system designers</h3>
    <ul class="margins">
        <li>
            <h4>Project managers and leads</h4>
            The structure is mostly organised as teams of people with similar skill sets, with directors and leads of
            smaller teams inside. Examples will be given for each team.
            <img src="assets/project-manager.avif" alt="" class="large-image">
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>System designers / creative leads & game designers</h4>
            The very 3rd person on Minecraft’s list of credits below the overall Head of Studios is the Chief Creative
            Officer. Brand Creative is a team that controls Minecraft’s creative direction and ensures that the overall
            lore is consistent and woven through every other team. In this way, they consider the purpose of the system
            and ensure that the game’s storyline aligns with it. For example, if the game developers thought that guns
            were a good addition, the creative leads would determine that it would not fit well with Minecraft’s target
            demographic and would harm the tranquillity fundamental to Minecraft’s design. The system designers would
            rebuke their idea as they reflect throughout the development process that the purpose is being met. Related
            are game designers that fulfil the creative direction that Minecraft will travel towards with engaging and
            meaningful gameplay mechanics and elements that are cohesive with the existing game.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="margins">Content providers</h3>
    <p class="margins">
        What separates content providers from other groups of roles is that they
    </p>
    <ol class="margins">
        <li>Do not include system employees but are instead paid by royalties or bid on specific projects.</li>
        <li>Often use pre-existing content as it is cheaper for the company developing the system.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul class="margins">
        <li>
            <h4>Translators</h4>
            Minecraft is translated by 35 115 volunteers on <a href="https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft">Crowdin</a>
            into over 100 different languages. This content is not pre-existing, however, since there is no contractual
            agreement that each contributor is Minecraft’s employee, it is an example of content being provided to
            Minecraft’s system. While there are no monetary incentives, there is lots of progress because of the
            community’s goodwill and incentives such as cosmetic capes that were provided to 29 Icelandic
            translators<sup>[<a href="https://twitter.com/jeb_/status/202681694132772864?lang=en">1</a>]</sup>.

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Sound effects</h4>
            Many of Minecraft’s sound effects come from Freesound<sup>[<a href="https://qr.ae/prTgHv">2</a>]</sup>. Some
            of them are provided below for you to sample.
            <table class="column-margins">
                <tr>
                    <td>Pig death sound by <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Erdie/sounds/44273/">Erdie</a></td>

                    <td><audio controls src="audio/cmusounddesign-bm-glass-break.wav"></audio></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Kitten sound by <a

                </tr>
            </table>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Minecraft Marketplace</h4>
            Minecraft has a marketplace where you can pay for community-made content such as worlds, skins, and texture
            packs. Contractors creating content for Minecraft Marketplace must be a regionally registered business in
            many parts of the world because of laws such as GST. Both an empirical test of <a
                href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/registration/AccountInfo?accountProgram=Minecraft">Australia’s
                region</a> and <a href="https://noxcrew.com/help/minecraft-marketplace-community-creators">Noxcrew</a>,
            who are the Marketplace’s 2nd largest partner confirm this. The executive producer of Minecraft Realms said
            “The easiest thing to say is: over half is getting paid to the creators. The contracts that we have written
            with them are more precise than that obviously, but that’s what we’re sharing.”<sup>[<a
                    href="https://mashable.com/article/minecraft-marketplace-details-interview">3</a>]</sup>. They pay
            royalties as a percentage of total revenue made from sales.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="margins">Media creators and editors</h3>
    <ul class="margins">
        <li>
            <h4>Artists</h4>
            Mojang employs many types of artists:
            <ul>
                <li>Art directors who are project managers</li>
                <li>Generalist artists</li>
                <li>Animators</li>
                <li>3D artists</li>
                <li>Motion graphics designers</li>
            </ul>
            A combination of project managers, generalists and specialists work together to create all the art required
            for Minecraft such as the splash screen and textures of entities, blocks and inventory items.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Audio engineers</h4>
            Includes Lead Sound Designer, musicians and sound effect artists. Minecraft created original music and some
            original sound effects instead of outsourcing all of it. Some music is provided below for you to sample.
            <table class="column-margins">
                <tr>
                    <td>Haggstorm by <a href="https://c418.org/">C418</a></td>
                    <td><audio controls src="audio/C418-haggstorm.webm"></audio></td>
                </tr>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Writers</h4>
            Minecraft.net needs many writers for their blog articles and support pages.
            <img src="assets/writer.jpg" alt="" class="large-image">
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="margins">Designers and layout specialists</h3>
    <ul class="margins">
        <li>
            <h4>Inventory & menu</h4>
            Minecraft has many user interface elements that need to be laid out by professionals. For example, iPads
            include touch controls that are intuitive to use and configurable, allowing the space button to be swapped
            with the sneak depending on what the player prefers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Website</h4>
            Minecraft.net’s web design is managed by Ten Gun Design, Inc.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="margins">Technical employees</h3>
    <ul class="margins">
        <li>
            <h4>Programmers</h4>
            They implement the vision that the game designers and creative direction team have. They are required to
            clarify with the designers exactly what needs to be done as well as prototype solutions to determine their
            feasibility. Programmers need to write code juggling many criteria such as the speed of writing it, its
            performance, its accuracy and its maintainability throughout the future. Not only do they program both
            Bedrock and Java Editions, but they program the launcher as well as Minecraft.net.
            <img src="assets/programmer.jpg" alt="" class="large-image">
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="margins">Other</h3>
    <p class="margins">
        There are some roles almost all retail businesses need, irrespective of industry. Minecraft employs a team of
        testers that have offices around the globe. Additionally, it has an extensive operations team involving Front of
        House receptionists, Human Resources and IT. Creative communication teams drive engagement through Social Media
        Managers. Even niche areas such as the legal, business, and financing teams that are useful to have but easy to
        overlook are employed by Mojang for Minecraft’s creation. Minecraft uses data analysts to inform others about
        pricing decisions and the user experience specialists how players play Minecraft. Minecraft also needs people to
        monitor customer support.
